        The Temple of Apollo Palatinus was 
        a temple to the god Apollo in Rome, 
        constructed on the Palatine Hill on the
         initiative of Augustus between 36 and 
         28 BCE. It was associated with Augustus
         's victories at the battles of 
         Naulochus and Actium; the latter was extensively 
        memorialised through its decoration.
